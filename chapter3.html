Repeating all the necessary statements every time is tedious and
error-prone. It would be better to put them in one place, and have the
program take a detour through there whenever necessary. This is what
<a name="key1"></a>functions were invented for: They are canned code that a program can
go through whenever it wants. Putting a string on the screen requires
quite a few statements, but when we have a <code>print</code> function we can
just write <code>print(&quot;Aleph&quot;)</code> and be done with it.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p6014048e" name="p6014048e"> ¶ </a>To view functions merely as canned chunks of code doesn't do them
justice though. When needed, they can play the role of pure functions,

control is given to the body of that function. When that body returns,

running, the computer must remember the context from which the

explores both the possibility of adding 5 to the current number and of
multiplying it by 3. When it finds the number, it returns the
<code>history</code> string, which is used to record all the operators that were
performed to get to this number. It also checks whether the current
number is bigger than <code>goal</code>, because if it is, we should stop
exploring this branch, it is not going to give us our number.</p><p><a class="paragraph" href="#p3417f4" name="p3417f4"> ¶ </a>The use of the <code>||</code> operator in the example can be read as 'return the

solution found by multiplying <code>start</code> by 3'. It could also have been
written in a more wordy way like this:</p><pre class="preformatted">else {

designers of JavaScript felt it would clarify things if function
bodies always had braces.</li><li><a name="footnote2"></a>Technically, a pure function can not use the value of any external
variables. These values might change, and this could make the function
return a different value for the same arguments. In practice, the
programmer may consider some variables 'constant' ― they are not
expected to change ― and consider functions that use only constant
variables pure. Variables that contain a function value are often good
examples of constant variables.</li></ol><div class="navigation"><a href="chapter2.html">&lt;&lt; Previous chapter</a> | <a href="contents.html">Contents</a> | <a href="index.html">Cover</a> | <a href="chapter4.html">Next chapter &gt;&gt;</a></div><div class="footer">© <a href="mailto:marijnh@gmail.com">Marijn Haverbeke</a> (<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">license</a>), written March to July 2007, last modified on August 14 2012.</div></div><script type="text/javascript" src="js/mochi.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/codemirror.js"> </script><script type="text/javascript" src="js/ejs.js"> </script></body></html>
